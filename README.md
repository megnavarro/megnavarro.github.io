Megan Navarro's Portfolio of Treehouse Projects

This portfolio was created using Express and Pug. It provides links to view all of the projects I have created as part of my Full-Stack JavaScript TechDegree from Treehouse. 

## Motivation
I am hoping to earn an Exceeds Expectations grade for this project.

## Features to Earn Exceeds
<ul>
<li> Running npm start serves the app.</li>
<li> error.pug template has been created.</li>
<li> When the app is directed at a non-existent route, like /error/error, the app displays a user friendly error page in the browser that details the following: error.message, error.status, and error.stack</li>
<li>CSS Changes include: Site-wide font change to Roboto Slab; .portfolio-me  changes to background color, font color, learn more (font size, weight, and color on hover); .cell .thumbnail animation added to bounce on hover</li> 
</ul>

## License
